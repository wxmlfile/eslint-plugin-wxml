# wxml/max-lines

## Background

::: tip Max Lines

Some people consider large files a code smell. Large files tend to do a lot of things and can make it hard following what's going. While there is not an objective maximum number of lines considered acceptable in a file, most people would agree it should not be in the thousands. Recommendations usually range from 100 to 500 lines. same with official `eslint` rules [max-lines](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-lines), but for `wxml`. 

:::

## Motivation

This rule enforces a maximum number of lines per file, in order to aid in maintainability and reduce complexity.

::: warning
Please note that most editors show an additional empty line at the end if the file ends with a line break. This rule does not count that extra line.

### Config Example 1

```json
{ "wxml/max-lines": ["error", 6] }

<!-- comment also will be count as lines -->
<view line="1">
  <view line="2">
    <view line="3"></view>

</view>
```
